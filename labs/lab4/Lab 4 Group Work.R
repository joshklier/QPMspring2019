## 1. Write the names of all group members.
# Josh Klier, Michael Rimmey, Luke Ehrenstrom


## 2. Read in the Trump Job Approval poll data.
##    Variables are as follows:
##    - Approve = Proportion of the respondents who approve Trump
##    - survey_house = Survey company
##    - end_date = Date the survey ended
##    - sample_subpopulation = Sample type
##    - observations = Number of observations
##    - mode = Survey method



## 3. Plot a histogram of the Trump job approval rates. 



## 4. Suppose you only have the "Gallup" poll from "2/19/2017". If we know that
##    the population variance is 0.25, what is your estimate of the sampling 
##    distribution? 
##    Hint: Find this poll using two conditions (survey_house, end_date)



## 5. According to your answer in Q4, what are the 20th and 75th quantiles of 
##    the distribution?



## 6. Suppose a new poll suggests that the Trump approval rate is 47%. 
##    According to your answer in Q4, what is the probability of a poll showing 
##    support for Trump higher than this?
